# MyStrings
A simple program that creates a class wrapper over C strings (char * / const char *).
I tried to create a class that would feature some functionality of the std :: string class.
A file "mystring.h" is a header file with a class, mystring, inserted into a namespace, Mystring.
"Mystring.cpp" is a source file with definitions of the class-member functions of the class mystring.
mystring.cpp is a file that demonstrates the usage of mystring class.
